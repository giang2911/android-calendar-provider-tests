Originally developed for a quick <a href='http://bit.ly/c2kYWk'>article</a>, now released as open source, this project is a developer oriented project to show how to use the calendar content provider on Android.

Use at your own risk. This content provider can, will, and does change so your app will break. Don't blame us. We aren't responsible for any harm whatsoever in this use of this code. It's being provided in response to requests for it. Freedom of speech, right?

All code output goes to logcat output. Code must be run on a handset.

**Please note**: With Android Level 14 (aka Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich) official, public calendar APIs are now available. Please use those withe Level 14 and above. See the [CalendarContract](http://goo.gl/sgdmL) class and the [Android Blog post](http://goo.gl/cLWNc) on the topic.
